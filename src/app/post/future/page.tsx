      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The rapid evolution of technology has brought us to a pivotal point in history. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword; it has become a transformative force that is reshaping industries and redefining how we live, work, and interact with the world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        From autonomous vehicles to personalized medicine, AI is driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data, unlocking insights and solving problems previously thought insurmountable.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        But what lies beyond AI? Emerging technologies such as quantum computing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics promise to push the boundaries of what’s possible even further. These breakthroughs could usher in an era of unparalleled progress, but they also bring ethical dilemmas and societal challenges that we must address.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        As we stand on the brink of this technological revolution, it’s crucial to ask the right questions: How do we ensure that AI and other technologies serve humanity’s best interests? What policies and safeguards must we implement to prevent misuse? And how can we prepare for a future that is constantly evolving?
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The future of technology is both exciting and uncertain. By fostering collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and society at large, we can navigate this journey responsibly and unlock the full potential of AI and beyond.
